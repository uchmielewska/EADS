## Project 1 
Single-linked list of elements. Elements store information about two different data types (integer “key” and character “info”). The main purpose of the task was to design a function “Split” which divides one single-linked list, into two separate lists under set conditions. 

###### Testing:
Main file consists of tests of all functions. It is divided into parts:
1. Tests of all “add” functions 
2. Test of “remove” functions
3. Test of operators (however “==” and “!=” operators can be check by the returned values)
4. Split function test

###### Functions:
All functions are described in the code for an easier understanding of their operations.

###### Split :
1. If “source” list is empty, returns unchanged “result1” and “result2” lists
2. Iterates through the “source” list to find the “start” node 
3. There are 3 while loops
a. Until repetitions of copying elements work for both result lists
b. When nodes are copied only into the first list
c. When nodes are copied only into the second lis
